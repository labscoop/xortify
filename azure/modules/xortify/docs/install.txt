|  You will need to install the following cron within your cronjobs section of your |
|  Wesite, if you are using a windows server in WAMP then you will need to schedule |
|  this as a task, remember to change the path to suit your configuration.          |
|                                                                                   |

| Assuming you have your PHP added to your executable path this is the scheduled    |
| task to run on a windows environment.                                             |
|                                                                                   |
